# A picobot program that can solve a maze, using the right-hand rule

# State 0: moving north
0 *x** -> E 1    # we can turn right!
0 xE** -> N 0
0 NE** -> X 3

# State 1: moving east
1 ***x -> S 3    # we can turn right!
1 *x*S -> E 1
1 *ExS -> X 2

# State 2: moving west
2 x*** -> N 0    # we can turn right!
2 N*x* -> W 2
2 NxW* -> X 1

# State 3: moving south
3 **x* -> W 2    # we can turn right!
3 **Wx -> S 3
3 x*WS -> X 0
